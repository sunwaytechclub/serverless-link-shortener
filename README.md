There are only 2 endpoints:

GET - `https://<your_url>/{name}`:

- A get request with name as the path parameters, example be like: `https://8onb6olqak.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/amazon`. It will redirect you to the actual url behind this shorterned link.

- A post request with the following field:
  - name: The name of the shorterned url
  - url: The actual url that will be redirected to
- You will need to add `X-Token` to your request's header with the token, else you will get `Unauthorized` response ( You may ask the committee incharge for the API token )
